# The Persistent Appointments
## A Discworld Tale

*In which Commander Sam Vimes discovers that Death has developed something of a following habit, and that the universe has a sense of humor that would make the gods weep (if they weren't too busy laughing).*

---

### Chapter 1: The First Appointment

Commander Sam Vimes sat behind his desk at the Watch House, glowering at a stack of paperwork that seemed to have bred overnight. The forms multiplied when you weren't looking, he was certain of it. Like bureaucracy, but with more paper cuts and less immediate threat to democracy.

The door opened without a knock, which was either very rude or very alarming. In Ankh-Morpork, it was usually both, and occasionally profitable for the right sort of person.

GOOD EVENING, COMMANDER VIMES.

Vimes looked up to see a tall figure in a black robe holding a scythe. Most people would have been terrified. Vimes was mostly annoyed that he'd have to fill out more paperwork. Death had a tendency to generate formsâ€”usually ones that began with "Incident Report" and ended with "Cause of Death: Occupational Hazard."

"Death," he said, with the same tone he might use for 'Oh, it's raining again, and I forgot my umbrella, and the gutters are backing up.' "What brings you to my office? Please tell me you're not here about the Thieves' Guild incident. I filed all the proper forms. In triplicate. With the right color ink."

I AM NOT HERE IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY, Death said, settling into the chair across from Vimes' desk. The chair creaked ominously, though whether from Death's presence or the general state of Watch House furniture was unclear. The Watch budget had never been what you might call generous, and the furniture had seen better decades.

"Unofficial, eh?" Vimes leaned back, studying Death's skull. It was, he had to admit, a very well-constructed skull. Professional grade. "Social call? Bit late for that, isn't it? Though I suppose your working hours are more... flexible than most."

I WANTED TO DISCUSS YOUR RECENT... ADVENTURES, Death said, and somehow managed to make the word 'adventures' sound like it should be followed by a long list of insurance claims.

"Which ones? I have adventures the way other people have breakfast. Regularly, with varying degrees of indigestion, and occasionally involving things that shouldn't be edible but somehow are."

YOUR TENDENCY TO AVOID DYING, Death clarified, his voice carrying the sort of patience usually reserved for explaining simple concepts to very small children or very large politicians. THE UNIVERSE IS BECOMING SOMEWHAT... CONFUSED BY THIS.

Vimes pulled out a cigar and lit it, offering one to Death out of politeness. Death declined with a gesture that suggested he had other habits, possibly involving less tar and more existential dread.

"Not avoiding it on purpose," Vimes said, taking a contemplative puff. "Just too stubborn to lie down when people expect me to. It's a character flaw, according to my wife. She has a list."

INDEED. I HAVE NOTICED THAT YOU TREAT MORTAL PERIL THE WAY MOST PEOPLE TREAT A MILD INCONVENIENCE.

"Occupational hazard. In my line of work, if you worried about dying every time someone tried to kill you, you'd never get any real work done. And there's always real work to be done in this city. Crime doesn't take holidays."

Death appeared to consider this, his skull tilting in a way that suggested deep thought, or possibly a crick in his metaphysical neck.

IF I MAY OBSERVE, COMMANDER, YOU SEEM TO HAVE TURNED CYNICISM INTO AN ART FORM.

"Years of practice. Also, living in Ankh-Morpork helps. The city will make anyone cynical, given enough time and exposure to municipal government. It's like radiation, but with more corruption and less useful medical applications."

I FIND YOUR PERSPECTIVE... REFRESHING, Death admitted. MOST PEOPLE EITHER FEAR ME OR TRY TO BARGAIN WITH ME. THE BARGAINING IS PARTICULARLY TEDIOUS.

"Can't see the point in either. You've got a job to do, same as me. Difference is, people actually want to see you coming. Eventually."

Death's skull managed to convey amusement without actually changing expression, which was a neat trick that probably took centuries to master.

THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR BEING APPRECIATED, Death agreed. TELL ME, COMMANDER, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE THE ONLY HONEST POLICEMAN IN THE MOST DISHONEST CITY IN THE WORLD?

Vimes took a long draw on his cigar, watching the smoke curl toward the ceiling where it joined the accumulated atmosphere of decades of similar conversations with slightly less supernatural participants.

"Exhausting. Also, I'm not the only honest one anymore. Got a whole Watch full of them now. Frightening thought, really. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night wondering what I've unleashed on the world."

YOU HAVE BUILT SOMETHING LASTING.

"Built something bloody inconvenient for the criminal classes, anyway." Vimes studied Death's impassive face. "This isn't really about my dying habits, is it?"

YOU ARE PERCEPTIVE. I WANTED TO... COMMEND YOU, ACTUALLY.

"Commend me? What for? I haven't done anything particularly commendable lately. Unless you count arresting Lord Rust's nephew for public intoxication and disturbing the peace. That was quite satisfying, actually."

FOR BEING YOURSELF, DESPITE CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE TO BE OTHERWISE. IT IS RARER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

Vimes was quiet for a moment. Outside, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, with occasional breaks for petty theft and municipal corruption.

"Well," he said finally. "That's... unexpected. Not many people appreciate authenticity these days. It's considered poor form in polite society."

LIFE OFTEN IS UNEXPECTED. THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING.

Death stood, adjusting his robe with the practiced ease of someone who had been wearing the same outfit for millennia and had finally gotten the hang of it.

I SHOULD GO. I HAVE APPOINTMENTS TO KEEP.

"Always do. Thanks for stopping by, I suppose. Don't be a stranger."

OH, I WON'T BE, Death said, and there was something in his tone that should have warned Vimes, but didn't.

COMMANDER?

"Yeah?"

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

And then Death was gone, leaving only a faint scent of desert wind and the absolute certainty that, somewhere in the city, someone was having a much worse evening than Sam Vimes.

Vimes looked down at his paperwork, sighed, and got back to the business of being honest in a dishonest world.

After all, someone had to do it.

### Chapter 2: The Breakfast Incident

The next morning found Commander Vimes in Harga's House of Ribs, which occupied a special place in Ankh-Morpork's culinary ecosystem somewhere between "restaurant" and "biological warfare facility." The establishment had earned its reputation through a combination of aggressive pricing, mysterious ingredients, and the sort of robust approach to food safety that assumed anyone weak enough to be poisoned by breakfast probably wasn't cut out for life in the big city anyway.

The House of Ribs was located in a narrow building that leaned against its neighbors for support, much like its clientele. The windows were yellow with grease and decades of accumulated cooking smoke, which filtered the morning light into a golden haze that made everything look slightly more appetizing than it actually was. This was probably intentional. The air inside was thick enough to chew, heavy with the scents of frying meat, burnt coffee, and something that might have been bacon if bacon could be weaponized.

Vimes sat in his usual booth—scarred wood that had witnessed more confessions than most priest holes—reading his copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times while working his way through what Harga optimistically advertised as a "Full Breakfast." The meal consisted of items that had once, in their natural state, probably resembled food. The eggs had clearly led interesting lives before arriving on his plate, the bacon exhibited a structural integrity that suggested it could be used for light construction work, and the sausages had achieved a color not normally found in nature outside of certain tropical warning systems.

Vimes liked Harga's because it was honest about what it was—a place where you could get breakfast that would either kill you or make you strong enough to survive whatever the day had planned for you. Either way, you knew where you stood, which was more than could be said for most of Ankh-Morpork's civic institutions.

He was contemplating an object that Harga claimed was a grilled tomato but which bore a suspicious resemblance to something that might explode under pressure, when the morning light seemed to dim slightly. This wasn't unusual in Ankh-Morpork, where the light was regularly dimmed by everything from industrial smoke to localized weather phenomena to the occasional dragon, but this particular dimming had a quality that suggested metaphysical rather than meteorological causes.

A familiar figure settled into the booth across from him with the sort of fluid motion that belonged to someone who didn't need to worry about the normal constraints of anatomy.

GOOD MORNING, COMMANDER.

"Death." Vimes didn't look up from his newspaper, which was running its usual mixture of political scandal, unexplained disappearances, and a surprisingly optimistic piece about a local merchant's plan to introduce "customer service" to Ankh-Morpork retail. The last item was filed under "Lifestyle" rather than "Comedy," which showed either remarkable editorial restraint or a complete lack of understanding about local economic conditions. "Bit early for you, isn't it? Don't you usually work the night shift, like burglars and other professionals?"

Death considered this question with the sort of careful attention most people reserved for mathematical theorems or their tax returns. I WORK ALL HOURS, ACTUALLY. DEATH DOESN'T KEEP REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS. THE UNIVERSE OPERATES ON A TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR SCHEDULE, BUT MORTALITY TENDS TO BE MORE... OPPORTUNISTIC.

"Right. Well, if you're here for Harga, you might want to wait. Pretty sure his cooking is going to finish the job eventually. Save you the trip." Vimes gestured at his plate with his fork, which had acquired a slight bend from wrestling with the bacon. "Though I suppose that would be death by natural causes. Or possibly death by unnatural causes, depending on what he's using for preservatives."

I AM NOT HERE ON BUSINESS.

This time Vimes did look up from his newspaper. Death was sitting perfectly still, skeletal hands folded on the table with the sort of precision that suggested either meditation or rigor mortis. His eye sockets were fixed on Vimes with the kind of attention that most people reserved for examining potentially dangerous animals or reading the fine print on insurance policies. It was the look of someone who was genuinely interested in the answer to a question he hadn't asked yet.

The sight was somewhat unnerving, partly because Death wasn't usually someone who waited for things. In the normal course of events, things waited for Death—usually while trying to run away, bargain for more time, or complete their tax returns. The idea of Death as a customer rather than a service provider suggested either a fundamental shift in the cosmic order or possibly just a very slow morning in the mortality business.

"Social call again?" Vimes asked, spearing something that might have been an egg, though it exhibited a suspicious resilience that suggested it had been fortified with materials not normally associated with poultry. "This is getting to be a habit."

HABITS ARE INTERESTING THINGS, Death observed with the sort of philosophical air that suggested he'd been giving the matter considerable thought. THEY PROVIDE STRUCTURE TO EXISTENCE. THEY CREATE PREDICTABILITY IN AN UNPREDICTABLE UNIVERSE. THEY ALLOW MORTALS TO FUNCTION WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSCIOUSLY DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE BREATHING EVERY FEW SECONDS.

"That's true," Vimes agreed, though he suspected Death's understanding of habits might be slightly different from the average person's. "My habit is trying to keep this city from falling apart completely. What's yours?"

DEATH IS NOT A HABIT. IT IS MORE OF A... CALLING. THOUGH I SUPPOSE ONE COULD ARGUE THAT ETERNAL EXISTENCE CREATES ITS OWN PATTERNS. THERE IS A CERTAIN RHYTHM TO MORTALITY THAT BECOMES... FAMILIAR.

"Right." Vimes chewed thoughtfully, noting that the mysterious breakfast item had the texture of something that could probably survive a small explosion. "So what brings you to breakfast? And please tell me you're not here to discuss my cholesterol levels. Lady Sybil already covers that topic thoroughly, with charts."

I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR DAILY ROUTINE.

"My routine?" Vimes raised an eyebrow, causing a small crease to appear in his forehead that had been worn there by years of dealing with municipal bureaucracy and criminal creativity. "It's not that interesting. Get up, try to prevent the city from burning down, go home, repeat. Occasionally there are riots, but those are usually scheduled in advance by the Guild of Rioters. Very professional organization, actually. They file proper paperwork and everything."

BUT YOU APPROACH EACH DAY AS IF IT MATTERS.

The observation hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implications that neither of them was quite ready to examine too closely.

"Well, yes. Because it does. Every day matters. That's the point." Vimes looked up from his breakfast, meeting Death's gaze directly in the way that most people found difficult and many found impossible. "If you don't act like today matters, you end up with a tomorrow that's worse than yesterday. Simple mathematics, really."

Death appeared to be thinking about this, which was somewhat unnerving. Death thinking was like watching someone juggle live grenades—fascinating in an intellectual sense, but suggesting the possibility of consequences that extended well beyond the immediate vicinity.

MOST PEOPLE SPEND THEIR LIVES PREPARING TO LIVE, Death observed, in the tone of someone who had been making notes.

"Most people are idiots," Vimes said cheerfully, attacking what appeared to be a sausage but might have been a small cylindrical building material. "Present company excepted, of course."

OF COURSE.

There was a comfortable silence, broken only by the sounds of other customers bravely tackling Harga's interpretation of morning nutrition. The restaurant's usual clientele consisted primarily of people whose relationship with food was based more on necessity than pleasure: night-shift workers heading home, day-shift workers summoning courage for the hours ahead, and the occasional tourist who had mistaken adventurous eating for actual adventure and was now learning the difference.

Vimes finished his breakfast with the sort of methodical determination that suggested either genuine hunger or a commitment to getting his money's worth. He stood to leave, noting that Death remained seated with the stillness of someone who either had nowhere else to be or was contemplating questions that didn't have easy answers.

"Well, this has been... educational. But I've got a city to police." Vimes folded his newspaper under his arm, the morning's headlines already becoming yesterday's problems. "Crime doesn't take breakfast breaks, unfortunately. More's the pity."

Death nodded with what might have been understanding. UNTIL NEXT TIME, COMMANDER.

"Next time?" But Death was already gone, leaving behind only the faint scent of desert winds and old libraries, and the nagging feeling that Vimes was missing something important. The spot where Death had been sitting showed no sign of recent occupation except for a slight coolness in the air and the distinct impression that something fundamental had shifted in the cosmic order.

Vimes paid Harga—who accepted the money with the sort of professional gratitude that suggested he understood the courage required to eat his cooking—and left a tip that was more superstition than service. In Ankh-Morpork, it was generally considered wise to stay on the good side of anyone who handled your food, especially if their definition of "food" was somewhat broader than most people's.

He headed toward the Watch House, unconsciously falling into the measured pace that had carried him through decades of police work, unaware that he was being followed by someone who cast no shadow, left no footprints, and was beginning to ask questions that didn't have comfortable answers.

### Chapter 3: The Domestic Consultation

That evening, Vimes arrived home to find the front door of Ramkin Manor standing open in a way that suggested either burglary or Lady Sybil's complete confidence in her ability to handle whatever might wander in. Given that this was Lady Sybil, and that she had once subdued an entire dragon with nothing but stern words and proper etiquette, Vimes suspected the latter.

The manor itself was a testament to what happened when old money met practical sensibility. The building had been in the Ramkin family for generations, accumulating both dignity and a certain comfortable shabbiness that suggested its owners were more concerned with substance than appearance. The hallway was lined with portraits of distinguished ancestors who had the sort of jaw-line that indicated centuries of telling other people what to do and expecting to be obeyed.

Vimes followed the sound of voices upstairs to the nursery, which Lady Sybil had transformed from the sort of sterile shrine to childhood that most aristocratic families favored into something that actually looked like children might live there. The walls were painted in cheerful colors, the floors were scattered with toys that showed evidence of actual use, and the overall atmosphere suggested that this was a place where learning happened through curiosity rather than discipline.

What was unusual was not Lady Sybil reading to Young Sam—that was as regular as sunrise and considerably more reliable than most of Ankh-Morpork's municipal services. What was unusual was that Death was sitting in the rocking chair next to her, apparently listening with rapt attention to "The Little Match Girl."

"Sam!" Lady Sybil looked up with the sort of calm pleasure that most people reserved for greeting expected dinner guests, rather than finding their husband standing in the doorway gaping at an anthropomorphic personification. "Your friend Death has been helping with story time. He has quite an interesting perspective on classic literature."

Lady Sybil's reaction to Death's presence was, Vimes reflected, entirely typical. She had been raised in the sort of household where one was taught to be polite to everyone, from visiting dignitaries to the occasional supernatural entity that might drop by for tea. Her education had included not only the usual accomplishments expected of a lady—languages, music, and the management of large households—but also a thorough grounding in what her governess had called "practical metaphysics." This was partly because the Ramkin family had always moved in circles where one might encounter anything from minor gods to major demons at dinner parties, and it was considered poor form to commit social gaffes due to ignorance about the nature of one's fellow guests.

Moreover, Lady Sybil had spent years breeding dragons, which had given her a practical understanding of the fact that the universe was considerably stranger and more interesting than most people imagined. Anyone who had successfully negotiated territorial disputes between highly intelligent reptiles was unlikely to be fazed by Death dropping by for a chat.

THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL IS A VERY POORLY STRUCTURED NARRATIVE, Death observed. THE ENDING IS UNNECESSARILY TRAGIC.

"Well, yes," Lady Sybil agreed. "Though I suppose it's meant to be a cautionary tale about social inequality."

Young Sam, who was three and had inherited his father's practical nature, looked up at Death with the sort of direct interest that only small children could manage.

"Are you really Death?" he asked.

YES.

"Do you have a horse?"

I HAVE BINKY. HE IS VERY RELIABLE.

"Can I ride him?"

I'M AFRAID THAT WOULD BE... PREMATURE.

"Oh." Young Sam considered this. "Do you want to hear about my toy soldiers?"

I WOULD FIND THAT EDUCATIONAL.

Vimes watched this exchange with the sort of bemused fascination usually reserved for watching natural disasters unfold in slow motion.

"Sybil," he said carefully, "why is Death in our nursery?"

"Well, dear, he was very interested in our child-rearing philosophies. Apparently, the literature on the subject is quite limited where he comes from." Lady Sybil turned a page. "And he's been very helpful. Did you know he's memorized most of the classic fairy tales?"

THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS ARE MUCH MORE ACCURATE, Death added. BEFORE THEY WERE... SANITIZED.

"Right," Vimes said. "Well, that's... educational."

Young Sam had begun arranging his toy soldiers in formation, explaining to Death the proper deployment of cavalry against infantry. Death listened with the sort of attention usually reserved for military briefings.

"He's quite good with children, actually," Lady Sybil observed. "Very patient. And he doesn't try to let Young Sam win at games, which is refreshing."

"You've been playing games?"

CHESS, Death said. HE IS QUITE SKILLED FOR SOMEONE WHO STILL COUNTS ON HIS FINGERS.

"I can count to twenty!" Young Sam announced proudly. "And Death taught me a new song!"

"A song?" Vimes asked, with the sort of parental dread that came from experience.

IT IS ABOUT SKELETONS, Death said defensively. IT IS EDUCATIONAL.

"Of course it is." Vimes settled into his chair, accepting that this was apparently his life now. "Well, don't let me interrupt story time."

Lady Sybil smiled and continued reading. Death occasionally interjected with historical corrections or alternative endings that were usually more optimistic than the originals. Young Sam fell asleep somewhere during "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," which Death had helpfully reinterpreted as a cautionary tale about breaking and entering and the importance of proper home security.

"Thank you for helping with bedtime," Lady Sybil whispered as they tiptoed out of the nursery.

I FOUND IT... ILLUMINATING, Death replied. CHILDREN HAVE A VERY DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH EXISTENCE.

"They do indeed. You're welcome to visit anytime, you know. Sam could use more friends who understand the importance of proper procedure."

Death nodded gravely and vanished, leaving behind the faint scent of eternity and the definite impression that Young Sam's bedtime stories would never be quite the same again.

"He's quite nice, really," Lady Sybil observed. "Though I do think his approach to fairy tales could use some work."

Vimes just nodded, making a mental note to have a word with Death about appropriate children's literature. Though, knowing Death, he had probably already considered the educational value of traditional stories versus their psychological impact on developing minds.

It was, Vimes reflected, going to be an interesting friendship.

### Chapter 4: The Patrol

Three days later, Vimes was on his rounds through the Shades, which was Ankh-Morpork's most honest neighborhood in the sense that everyone there was a criminal and didn't pretend otherwise. It was refreshing, in a way that could only be appreciated by someone who spent most of his working life dealing with people who stole money and called it taxation, or who murdered people and called it politics.

The Shades occupied a special place in Ankh-Morpork's geography—not just physical, but moral and philosophical as well. It was the sort of area that maps marked with the notation "Here Be Monsters," except that the monsters were generally more reasonable than the residents. The buildings leaned against each other for support, much like their inhabitants, and the streets followed the sort of logic that suggested they had been laid out by someone who had never heard of straight lines and considered them a dangerous foreign innovation.

During the day, the Shades maintained a certain shabby dignity, like a retired general who had seen better times but still insisted on wearing his medals. At night, however, it transformed into something altogether more primal. The darkness here was not just the absence of light but the presence of something else entirely—a quality of shadow that seemed to have weight and intention. It was the sort of darkness that made even experienced criminals check over their shoulders and walk a little faster.

Vimes, being neither sensible nor foolish but something else entirely—professional, perhaps, or possibly just too stubborn to admit that anything could frighten him after thirty years of police work—walked through these streets with the confidence of a man who had seen worse things than dark alleys filled with cutthroats. This was partly because he had, in fact, seen worse things, and partly because his reputation preceded him in ways that made most criminals decide they had urgent business elsewhere.

He had just finished explaining to a would-be mugger why attempting to rob the Commander of the City Watch was both a career-limiting move and a fundamental misunderstanding of the local power structure, when Death appeared at his elbow with the sort of casual materialization that suggested either considerable magical ability or a complete disregard for the normal laws of physics.

GOOD EVENING, COMMANDER. INTERESTING TECHNIQUE.

"Death." Vimes straightened his armor and continued walking, his boots echoing off the damp cobblestones with the sort of measured rhythm that had become as familiar to the Shades' residents as the city's bells. The sound had a curious effect on the local wildlife—both human and otherwise—causing pickpockets to suddenly remember urgent appointments elsewhere and causing at least one gargoyle to shift nervously on its perch. "You've been following me around a lot lately. People are going to talk."

I AM NOT CONCERNED WITH GOSSIP.

"No, I suppose you wouldn't be. Hard to damage the reputation of the inevitable." Vimes turned down Scandal Alley, which had earned its name through a combination of historical incidents and the sort of ongoing activities that made it unsuitable for family entertainment. He noted with professional interest that someone had improved the lighting—probably the local Thieves' Guild chapter, since good visibility was essential for quality muggings. Poor lighting led to embarrassing mistakes, such as attempting to rob people who were both armed and professional about violence.

YOU SEEM REMARKABLY CALM ABOUT MY PRESENCE.

"Should I be worried? Are you here in a professional capacity this time?"

NOT... EXACTLY.

"That's reassuring. Sort of." Vimes paused to help an elderly woman who had been relieved of her purse by a young entrepreneur. The purse was returned with a lecture on the economics of crime that left the thief looking confused and oddly educated.

I AM IMPRESSED BY YOUR... METHODOLOGY, Death observed as they continued their patrol.

"What methodology? I just do the job."

EXACTLY. Death seemed pleased by this response, which was somehow more disturbing than if he had seemed displeased.

They walked in companionable silence through the twisted streets, which seemed to rearrange themselves slightly when no one was looking—a common phenomenon in this part of the city, where the architecture had developed a certain creative independence over the centuries. Death's presence had an oddly calming effect on the local criminal element, though not in the way one might expect. Rather than fleeing in terror, the various practitioners of unofficial economics seemed to take his appearance as a sign that they should perhaps consider taking up safer professions. Burglars decided to call it an early night and spend quality time with their families. Pickpockets found themselves suddenly interested in honest work, or at least work that didn't involve personal contact with potential victims. Even the gargoyles looked nervous, which was remarkable given that they were generally considered to be among the city's more stoic residents.

"You know," Vimes said as they emerged onto Broad Way, which was broader than most streets in the Shades but still considerably narrower than its name suggested, "this is either the most surreal evening of my career, or I'm having some sort of breakdown. Either way, it's been educational." He paused to light a cigar, noting that the flame seemed steadier in Death's presence, as if even fire recognized something fundamental about his companion.

They paused outside a well-lit mansion where the sounds of a well-bred social gathering drifted through the windows like music played on instruments made of good breeding and old money. The contrast between the refined merriment inside and the gritty reality of the Shades outside was so stark it was almost philosophical.

I ASSUME THAT IS YOUR HOME?

"God, no. That's the Rust place. I live over there." Vimes pointed to a more modest but well-maintained building. "Lady Sybil will be wondering where I am. She's probably got Willikins watching for me with the good telescope."

WILLIKINS?

"The butler. Used to be quite handy with a knife, back in the day. Now he's handy with afternoon tea and tactical domestic management. Amazing what a good butler can do with a silver service and a properly threatening manner."

I HAVE MET FEW BUTLERS IN MY LINE OF WORK.

"That's because Willikins doesn't let people die in his house. Bad for the silverware, apparently. Says it's unprofessional."

I ENJOY OUR CONVERSATIONS, Death admitted. IT IS RARE TO MEET SOMEONE WHO TAKES DEATH IN STRIDE.

"Well, you seem like a reasonable sort of anthropomorphic personification. Professional, too. I respect that. Besides, if I worried about every supernatural entity that wandered through my life, I'd never get any sleep. Last week Lord Vetinari sent me a note asking about my health. I wasn't ill."

THE PATRICIAN HAS HIS OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH INEVITABILITY.

"Don't they all." Vimes checked his watch. "Speaking of inevitability, I should get home before Lady Sybil sends out a search party. She's got contacts in the Assassins' Guild, and they're very thorough."

Death appeared gratified by this assessment.

UNTIL TOMORROW, COMMANDER.

"Tomorrow?" But Death was gone again, leaving Vimes alone with the growing certainty that something very strange was happening, and that he was probably the last person in the city to figure out what it was.

### Chapter 5: The Wedding Committee

The day after Death's domestic visit, Vimes arrived at the Watch House to find the main office transformed into what appeared to be a strategic planning center for an operation of considerable complexity. This was notable because the Watch House's main office was normally the sort of place where strategic planning involved deciding whether to arrest someone today or wait until tomorrow when they might commit a crime that was actually worth the paperwork.

The Watch House itself was a building that had survived everything Ankh-Morpork could throw at it, which was considerable. It had been built in the practical architectural style known as "Fortress Brutalism," which favored thick walls, small windows, and the sort of design philosophy that assumed the building would eventually be attacked by something large and bad-tempered. Over the years, it had been renovated, expanded, and modified so many times that it now resembled less a coherent structure than a geological formation that had happened to develop doors and a roof.

Sergeant Colon, Nobby Nobbs, and Constable Cheery were huddled around Captain Carrot's desk like generals planning a campaign, which was not entirely inaccurate. The desk itself was a monument to organizational ambition—every surface covered with papers, lists, diagrams, and what appeared to be architectural sketches. Several different colored inks had been employed, suggesting either careful categorization or complete chaos, depending on one's perspective.

"...and then there's the question of flowers," Cheery was saying, consulting a list that appeared to have been written in multiple hands, several different languages, and at least one script that might have been Dwarfish runes. "The traditional human approach favors roses and lilies, but dwarf ceremonial practices typically incorporate battle-ready vegetation."

"Flowers are nice," Nobby offered helpfully, with the sort of enthusiasm that suggested he had recently discovered the concept and was eager to share his expertise. "I like daisies. They're... flowery."

"Nobody asked you, Nobby," Colon said, though not unkindly. He had developed a paternal tolerance for Nobby's contributions over the years, much the way one might develop tolerance for a mildly annoying but ultimately harmless pet. "This is serious business. Wedding planning is like military strategy, only with more cake and significantly less dying. Usually."

"What's all this then?" Vimes asked, settling behind his desk with his morning coffee.

"Oh, Commander!" Carrot looked up with the sort of enthusiasm that usually preceded requests for time off or budget increases. "We're helping plan my wedding to Angua!"

"Are you now? And when exactly did this engagement happen?"

"Well," Carrot said, looking slightly embarrassed, "it's more of a... preliminary planning committee. For when we do get engaged. Angua doesn't know about it yet."

Vimes stared at his officers. "You're planning a wedding that hasn't been proposed yet, for an engagement that doesn't exist, to someone who doesn't know about it?"

"Exactly!" Nobby said cheerfully. "We're being proactive. Like you always tell us to be."

"That's not what I meant by proactive, Nobby."

"The thing is," Cheery explained, "Captain Carrot is very methodical about these things. He wants to make sure everything is properly organized before he proposes."

"So he's planning the wedding before asking the question?"

"It's very romantic," Colon observed. "Shows forethought. My wife would have appreciated that level of planning. Instead of, you know, proposing on a Tuesday because the pub was closed."

"Right." Vimes took a long sip of his coffee. "And what exactly are you planning?"

Carrot consulted his notes. "Well, we've got the venue sorted—the small chapel in the Temple District, very tasteful. The catering will be handled by Harga, with supervision from the Dwarf Bread Museum to ensure proper cultural representation."

"Dwarf bread at a wedding?"

"Traditional dwarf weddings include battle rations," Cheery explained. "For symbolic purposes. And in case the reception gets rowdy."

"The entertainment will be provided by the Guild of Musicians," Carrot continued. "I've specifically requested no opera. Angua has very sensitive hearing."

"And I'm going to be a bridesmaid!" Nobby announced with the sort of pride usually reserved for announcing military honors or successful completion of advanced educational degrees.

Everyone turned to stare at him with the sort of unified attention that suggested either a collective realization of impending disaster or the recognition that they were witnessing something that would be talked about for years to come.

"Nobby," Vimes said carefully, employing the tone of voice he normally used for addressing armed suspects or potentially unstable explosive devices, "you do realize that bridesmaids are traditionally female?"

"Yeah, I know. That's why I've been practicing." Nobby struck a pose that was presumably meant to be feminine but mostly suggested someone who had learned about feminine grace from written descriptions that had been translated several times and possibly illustrated by someone who had never actually seen a woman. The overall effect was less "graceful maiden" and more "person having a mild seizure while attempting to remember complex choreography."

"Practicing what, exactly?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he was going to regret the question.

"Walking in heels, mostly. And talking in a higher voice. Also, curtseying." Nobby demonstrated a curtsey that would have been impressive if it hadn't been performed by someone wearing a guard's uniform, a crossbow slung over their shoulder, and what appeared to be at least three different types of armor. The attempt at feminine delicacy was somewhat undermined by the sound of chainmail clinking and the general impression that he was preparing to either dance or engage in small-scale warfare.

"Nobby, you can't be a bridesmaid."

"Why not? I've got experience with formal dress. Remember the opera thing?"

"That was undercover work."

"This could be undercover work too. I could be investigating... wedding crime."

"Wedding crime?"

"You know, cake theft, flower vandalism, inappropriate plus-ones. Very serious stuff."

Vimes looked around the room at his assembled officers, all of whom were nodding as if this made perfect sense.

"Right," he said finally. "Well, as long as this doesn't interfere with actual police work, I suppose it's... harmless enough. But Nobby, you're not wearing a dress to Carrot's wedding."

"What about a nice frock?"

"No frocks either."

"A tasteful ensemble?"

"Nobby, you're going to wear your dress uniform, and you're going to like it."

Nobby looked crestfallen. "But I look really good in blue."

"Your dress uniform is blue."

"I meant blue with ruffles."

"No ruffles."

The committee returned to their planning, now discussing seating arrangements and whether it would be appropriate to have the wedding cake decorated with tiny handcuffs ("for luck"). Vimes retreated to his office, making a mental note to have a quiet word with Angua about what her boyfriend's colleagues were up to.

Outside his window, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the Watch House, love was apparently being planned with military precision and an alarming amount of input from Nobby Nobbs.

It was, Vimes reflected, either the most romantic thing he'd ever witnessed, or the most elaborate practical joke in the history of law enforcement. Possibly both.

### Chapter 6: The Paperwork Consultation

The next day, Vimes was drowning in paperwork with the sort of methodical desperation that came from years of understanding that the forms would always win in the end, but that dignity required putting up a good fight. His desk had achieved that special state of chaos that suggested either complete organizational breakdown or a highly sophisticated filing system that defied conventional understanding. Papers were stacked in precarious towers that swayed gently in the breeze from the open window, creating a landscape of bureaucratic topography that would have impressed even the most dedicated civil servant.

The morning light filtering through the grimy windows of his office cast long shadows across the accumulated evidence of municipal administration. Forms 27-B nestled cozily against Incident Reports, while Budget Requisitions had apparently formed some sort of alliance with Overtime Authorization Requests. The overall effect was less "organized workspace" and more "archaeological site documenting the evolution of red tape."

Vimes was contemplating a particularly byzantine expense report that appeared to have been written in at least three different languages, possibly by someone who wasn't entirely sober, when Death materialized in the chair across from his desk with the sort of casual disregard for physical laws that suggested either considerable supernatural ability or a complete lack of respect for conventional reality.

The effect on Sergeant Colon, who had been in the process of delivering the morning's reports, was immediate and dramatic. He dropped his files, made a noise like a deflating balloon that had been taught to express existential dread, and achieved a complexion that suggested he was considering the relative merits of fainting versus running away very quickly.

"It's all right, Sergeant," Vimes said with the sort of calm that came from having one's expectations about normality permanently lowered through repeated exposure to Ankh-Morpork's civic life. "Death's just... consulting. On some cases."

THAT IS... ACCURATE, Death agreed, though his tone suggested that accuracy and truth were not necessarily the same thing. This observation did nothing to improve Sergeant Colon's complexion, which had now achieved a shade that most people would have associated with either serious illness or advanced terror.

The door burst open and Captain Carrot peered in, all six and a half feet of him radiating concern and civic duty.

"Commander, we heard a commotion and—oh, hello!" Carrot beamed with the sort of genuine enthusiasm that made hardened criminals confess to jaywalking, consider taking up honest professions, and occasionally write thank-you letters to their arresting officers. His ability to radiate civic virtue was so pronounced that it had been known to cause moral improvement in people who merely stood near him for extended periods. "I don't believe we've been introduced!"

HELLO, CAPTAIN CARROT. I AM... PLEASED TO MEET YOU, Death replied, and there was something in his tone that suggested he genuinely was pleased, in the way that someone might be pleased to encounter a particularly well-crafted piece of machinery or a flawlessly executed work of art.

Behind Carrot, Sergeant Angua's nose twitched with the sort of precision that came from having senses considerably more acute than those possessed by normal humans. Her expression suggested someone trying to identify a scent that was both familiar and impossible. "Interesting," she observed quietly, her voice carrying the careful neutrality of someone who had learned that commenting too directly on supernatural phenomena usually led to paperwork. "He smells like... desert sand and old libraries. And something else I can't quite place. Something very... final."

"This is Mr..." Vimes paused, realizing that in all their conversations, he'd never actually arranged a cover identity for Death, which was the sort of oversight that suggested either complete trust or complete failure of imagination.

MR. FINAL, Death offered helpfully, with the air of someone who had given the matter some thought and arrived at what he considered a reasonable solution.

"Mr. Final," Vimes continued. "He's consulting on some administrative matters."

"Ooh, consultant!" Nobby Nobbs had appeared from somewhere, as he tended to do when things got interesting. "What's your specialty then? Fraud? Taxes? Municipal drainage?"

CONCLUSIONS, Death said solemnly.

"Final Conclusions," Nobby mused. "Sounds very... definitive."

"Right then," said Colon, though he seemed oddly reluctant to get too close. "Well, if you need any help with... er... consulting, we're very experienced. Though I have to say, is it just me, or did it get rather cold in here?"

I APOLOGIZE IF MY PRESENCE IS... CHILLING.

Carrot was studying Death with the sort of thoughtful expression he wore when something wasn't quite adding up. "Mr. Final," he said slowly, "forgive me, but have we met before? You seem very... familiar. And that voice..."

I HAVE A VERY... DISTINCTIVE MANNER OF SPEAKING.

"Yes," Carrot said, still thoughtful. "Yes, you certainly do. Commander, might I have a word with you later about... administrative procedures?"

Vimes caught Carrot's meaningful look. "Of course, Captain."

The others gradually drifted away, though Angua kept glancing back with a puzzled expression, and Colon muttered something about checking the heating system.

"You're going to give my men nervous breakdowns," Vimes observed.

THEY WILL RECOVER. HUMANS ARE REMARKABLY RESILIENT.

"True. So, what brings you by today? Please tell me you're not here to help with the paperwork. That would be too weird, even for this city."

Death looked at the towering stacks of forms with what might have been interest.

I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. IT IS... THOROUGH.

"That's one word for it. Bureaucracy is like a disease—once it gets started, it spreads everywhere. Soon you need forms to get forms to fill out other forms."

THE SYSTEM SEEMS INEFFICIENT.

"Welcome to government work. The inefficiency is a feature, not a bug. It prevents anyone from actually getting anything done, which some consider a good thing."

Death picked up a form and examined it with the sort of attention usually reserved for ancient texts or particularly complex magical theorems.

THIS APPEARS TO BE A REQUEST FOR PERMISSION TO REQUEST PERMISSION.

"That's Form 27-B. You need it to apply for Form 31-C, which lets you request Form 42-A. Which is the actual form you wanted in the first place."

Death considered this. THE PERSON WHO DESIGNED THIS SYSTEM WAS EITHER A GENIUS OR COMPLETELY INSANE.

"Probably both. Genius and insanity aren't mutually exclusive in government work. In fact, they're often considered prerequisites."

I AM BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SMOKE.

"The cigarettes, or the fact that I occasionally consider setting fire to the whole filing system?"

YES.

They worked in comfortable silence for a while, Death occasionally asking questions about various forms and procedures. His interest seemed genuine, which was both flattering and disturbing.

"Can I ask you something?" Vimes said, finally pushing aside a stack of requisition forms.

OF COURSE.

"Why are you following me around? Not that I mind the company, but it's getting a bit... noticeable."

Death was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice carried an odd note of something that might have been uncertainty.

I AM... CONDUCTING A STUDY.

"A study? What kind of study?"

ON THE NATURE OF... PERSISTENCE.

"Persistence?"

YOU CONTINUE TO EXIST, DESPITE THE UNIVERSE'S APPARENT EFFORTS TO CORRECT THIS SITUATION.

"The universe is trying to kill me?"

THE UNIVERSE IS TRYING TO KILL EVERYONE. IT IS REMARKABLY CONSISTENT IN THIS REGARD. BUT MOST PEOPLE COOPERATE MORE READILY.

"I see. And you're studying my lack of cooperation?"

AMONG OTHER THINGS.

"What other things?"

But Death was already fading, leaving behind only the lingering scent of eternity and the definite impression that Vimes was asking the wrong questions.

### Chapter 7: The Late Night Encounter

It was well past midnight—that particularly dark and philosophical hour when the city's daytime pretenses fell away like makeup in the rain, revealing the true face of Ankh-Morpork underneath. This was the hour when honest citizens were safely tucked away behind locked doors, when the streets belonged to those whose relationship with the law was more theoretical than practical, and when the very shadows seemed to develop opinions about municipal policy.

Vimes was making his way through the narrow alleys of the Shades with the sort of determined trudge that spoke of a man who understood that duty was often uncomfortable, frequently thankless, and occasionally involved getting one's boots wet in substances that were better left unidentified. The alleys at this hour had the quality of a maze designed by someone with a particularly twisted sense of humor—they seemed to rearrange themselves when no one was looking, and they invariably led to places that weren't on any official map and probably shouldn't be.

His feet hurt with the sort of persistent ache that came from walking on cobblestones that had been laid by craftsmen who apparently believed that uniformity was a dangerous foreign concept. His back ached with the accumulated weight of thirty years of police work, during which he had learned that maintaining law and order was considerably more complicated than the law books suggested. He was beginning to think that commanding the Watch would be a lot easier if crime kept regular business hours, filed proper paperwork, and possibly took weekends off.

The night air carried the usual mixture of scents that made the Shades distinctive: smoke from a dozen different kinds of fires, cooking food of questionable origin, and the sort of organic decomposition that suggested the municipal sanitation department's efforts were more aspirational than effective. It was the smell of a neighborhood that had given up on respectability and settled for survival, which was probably a more honest approach than most of the city managed.

As he turned into Rope Street—which had earned its name through a combination of historical incidents and ongoing practical applications—he spotted a small group huddled around a barrel fire in an alleyway. The fire cast dancing shadows on the walls, creating a primitive theater where ordinary objects became mysterious and threatening. Foul Ole Ron was there, along with Coffin Henry, the Duck Man, and Arnold Sideways. They appeared to be having some sort of meeting, though what the Canting Crew might have to meet about at this hour was anyone's guess. In Vimes's experience, the Canting Crew's meetings could cover anything from municipal philosophy to the best places to find day-old bread, and the distinction between the two was often less clear than one might expect.

Vimes approached quietly, partly from professional habit and partly because he was curious what passed for conversation among Ankh-Morpork's most creative beggars.

"Buggrit! Millennium hand and shrimp!" Ron was saying, which seemed to pass for either agreement or disagreement, depending on context.

"The Duck Man's got a point," said a voice from near Ron's feet. "Though personally, I think the whole concept of private property is a bit dodgy when you get down to it."

"I said, you can't call them criminals," the Duck Man was saying with the sort of philosophical authority that came from years of thinking deeply about subjects that most people preferred to ignore. "Not when the system's rigged from the start. What's crime, anyway? Just a failure to bribe the right people."

"Quack," said a duck that happened to be standing nearby, though whether this was commentary, agreement, or simple coincidence was unclear. The duck had the sort of expression that suggested it might have opinions about municipal corruption, but was keeping them to itself for reasons of personal safety.

"Too right," agreed a voice that seemed to be coming from somewhere near ground level. "Though I have to say, from a dog's perspective, the whole concept of ownership is a bit silly anyway. I mean, can you really own a bone? Or does the bone just happen to be in your possession temporarily? And don't get me started on the philosophical implications of territory marking."

A dog's perspective? Vimes looked more carefully at the group and spotted a small, scruffy terrier sitting near the fire, apparently warming himself against the night's chill. The animal had the sort of battle-scarred appearance that came from years of surviving on the streets, but there was something in its posture that suggested intelligence considerably beyond the normal canine range. The dog was looking directly at him with bright, knowing eyes that seemed to contain far more awareness than should have been anatomically possible.

But when their gazes met, the animal immediately adopted the vacant expression of a creature whose primary concerns were food, belly rubs, and the occasional opportunity to bark at interesting smells. The transformation was so complete and so sudden that Vimes might have doubted what he'd seen, except that thirty years of police work had taught him to trust his instincts about when something was not quite what it seemed.

"Right then," Vimes said aloud, approaching the group. "Evening, gentlemen. Everything all right here?"

"Buggrit! Evening! Millennium hand and shrimp!" Ron said with enthusiasm.

"Ron's explaining his theory of social justice," Coffin Henry translated helpfully.

"Were you now?" Vimes looked around the group. All appeared perfectly normal, if you considered any member of the Canting Crew normal. "And what conclusions have you reached?"

"Well," said Coffin Henry, "we've decided that the world's gone mad, but since we was already mad to begin with, we're now relatively sane."

"That's... logical, I suppose."

The dog yawned and stretched, performing a convincing impression of an animal with no thoughts beyond basic survival. But Vimes could have sworn he caught a look of amused intelligence in its eyes.

"Woof," said the dog, but somehow managed to make it sound sarcastic.

It was at this point that Death materialized beside the fire, causing the flames to flicker slightly. The Canting Crew greeted this development with the sort of mild interest they might show for a new type of weather.

"Evening, officer," said Coffin Henry politely. The Canting Crew had developed an excellent sense for identifying law enforcement, even when it came in unusual forms.

GOOD EVENING, Death replied politely.

"Buggrit! Lovely night! Shrimp!" Ron added enthusiastically.

"For what?" Vimes asked.

"Oh, you know. Existence. Being. The general business of not being dead yet," Coffin Henry explained, gesturing vaguely at the world in general. "Ron's very philosophical about these things."

Death appeared to find this response satisfactory and settled down near the fire, somehow managing to look both ominous and companionable.

"Interesting group," Vimes observed.

I AM FASCINATED BY THE... PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS.

"You can hear them too?" Vimes asked, though he wasn't entirely sure what he meant by that.

The dog had been listening to this exchange with apparent interest, but when Death's gaze fell on him, he immediately began scratching behind his ear with the sort of focused concentration that suggested this was the most important task in the world.

Death stared at the dog for a long moment.

THERE IS SOMETHING... UNUSUAL... ABOUT THAT ANIMAL.

"Unusual how?" Vimes asked.

THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH ARE SOMETIMES... PERMEABLE. ESPECIALLY FOR CREATURES WHO EXIST ON THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY.

"Meaning?"

SOME ANIMALS... ACQUIRE CHARACTERISTICS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH... HIGHER FORMS OF EXISTENCE.

The dog looked up from his scratching and gave Death a look that was entirely too knowing for a simple street animal. For a moment, their gazes locked, and Vimes had the distinct impression that some sort of communication was taking place.

Then the dog yipped once, in a way that sounded almost like "Woof," but not quite, and trotted away into the shadows.

"Peculiar animal," Vimes muttered.

INDEED, Death agreed. MOST... ENLIGHTENING.

"Right then," Vimes said, deciding he was definitely too tired for whatever was happening here. "Well, gentlemen, try to keep the philosophical discussions to a reasonable volume. Some of us are trying to sleep."

"Buggrit! Sleep tight! Millennium hand and shrimp!" Ron called out cheerfully.

As Vimes walked away, he could hear the group resuming their discussion, though he could have sworn he occasionally heard a fifth voice that seemed to be coming from somewhere near ground level, offering observations about the social contract and the distribution of food scraps.

But when he looked back, there were only four humans around the fire, and no sign of the scruffy dog anywhere.

He was definitely too tired for this sort of thing, Vimes decided. Tomorrow, he was going to have a serious conversation with Lady Sybil about the benefits of early retirement.

Behind him, Death remained by the fire for a few more minutes, apparently deep in thought about the nature of consciousness, communication, and the remarkable ability of some creatures to exist in the spaces between definitions.

Then he too faded away, leaving the Canting Crew to their eternal discussion of life's great mysteries and the best places to find day-old bread.

### Chapter 8: The Unconventional Patrol

A week later, Vimes was doing his evening rounds through the more respectable parts of the city—the sort of neighborhood where the criminals wore better clothes and committed more expensive crimes, but were generally more polite about it. The transition from the Shades to Scoone Avenue was like stepping from one world into another, or possibly from one century into another, depending on one's perspective on urban development and social progress.

Scoone Avenue represented Ankh-Morpork's attempt at genteel respectability. The buildings were taller, cleaner, and showed evidence of recent maintenance. The streets were wider, the lighting was better, and the general atmosphere suggested that this was a place where people worried more about property values than immediate survival. It was the sort of neighborhood where crime was conducted with proper paperwork and a reasonable respect for social conventions.

The evening light cast long shadows between the well-maintained buildings, creating the sort of urban landscape that suggested civilization had made a serious effort and was quite pleased with the results. Gas lamps provided pools of warm light at regular intervals, and the overall effect was considerably more wholesome than anything the Shades had to offer. This was probably why Vimes always felt slightly uncomfortable here—too much wholesomeness made him suspicious.

He was contemplating the philosophical implications of municipal lighting policy when he spotted two figures on patrol near the intersection with Treacle Mine Road. One was clearly Sergeant Colon, instantly recognizable by his distinctive waddle and the way he held his truncheon like it might suddenly develop teeth and attempt to bite him. Colon's approach to law enforcement was based on the theory that most criminals could be discouraged through the application of reasonable conversation and the implied threat of paperwork.

The other figure appeared to be a woman in a blue dress and bonnet, walking with a gait that suggested either recent injury, unfamiliarity with feminine footwear, or possibly both. The dress was clearly expensive—silk, by the look of it—but it had been fitted to someone with dramatically different proportions than its current wearer. The overall effect was less "elegant lady" and more "person attempting to impersonate an elegant lady based on written descriptions."

Vimes approached with the sort of professional interest that came from years of recognizing trouble before it fully materialized.

"Evening, Sergeant," he called out.

Colon spun around with the guilty expression of a man caught doing something he couldn't quite explain.

"Oh! Commander! Lovely evening for a patrol, isn't it?"

"Indeed. And your... companion?"

The woman in blue turned around, revealing a face that was definitely familiar despite the application of what appeared to be Lady Sybil's rouge and powder.

"Evening, Mister Vimes!" Nobby said in a voice pitched approximately three octaves higher than usual. "Lovely night, isn't it? Perfect for... patrol activities."

Vimes stared. "Nobby, why are you wearing a dress?"

"Dress?" Nobby looked down at himself as if noticing his attire for the first time. "This old thing? It's not a dress, it's a... tactical urban camouflage ensemble."

"It's a dress, Nobby."

"Well, technically, yes. But it's for police work!"

"Police work."

"Yeah!" Nobby's enthusiasm was only slightly dampened by his attempt to maintain a feminine voice. "See, we've been having trouble with that pickpocket who's been working the market, right? The one who only targets lone women?"

"Go on."

"Well, Sergeant Colon here had the brilliant idea that we could catch him in the act. I volunteer to be the bait, being as I'm naturally... compelling."

Vimes looked at Nobby, who was indeed compelling, though not necessarily in the way they intended. The dress was blue silk, clearly expensive, and appeared to have been borrowed from someone with significantly different proportions. The bonnet was askew, the makeup was applied with more enthusiasm than skill, and Nobby's attempts at walking in heels were producing a gait that could charitably be described as "interpretive."

"Compelling," Vimes repeated.

"Oh yes," Colon interjected. "Very convincing. We've had three marriage proposals already."

"Marriage proposals?"

"Well, two marriage proposals and one business proposition," Nobby corrected. "I told them I was already spoken for. Maintaining character, you understand."

"Character."

"Yes! I'm Lady Nobitha of... er... Ankh. I'm new in town, looking for a nice little shop to buy. Very innocent, very vulnerable, perfect pickpocket bait."

Vimes studied Nobby's ensemble more carefully. "That's Lady Sybil's dress."

"She said I could borrow it!" Nobby said quickly. "For official police business! She was very understanding about the whole thing. Even gave me tips on walking in heels."

"Lady Sybil taught you to walk in heels."

"She's very supportive of innovative policing techniques. Also, she said the blue brings out my eyes."

Vimes closed his eyes and counted to ten. When he opened them, Nobby was still there, still in a dress, still looking quite pleased.

"And has this... innovative technique... produced any results?"

"Well," Colon said, "we did catch three pickpockets, two confidence tricksters, and a man selling fake jewelry."

"Really?"

"Yeah, but they weren't the ones we were looking for. Turns out there's a lot more crime in this area than we thought. Who knew women had to deal with this sort of thing all the time?"

"Educational experience, then."

"Very educational," Nobby agreed. "Did you know that walking in heels is basically a form of torture? And don't get me started on this corset thing. I don't know how women breathe in these things."

"You're wearing a corset?"

"Lady Sybil insisted. Said it was important for proper posture and authenticity. I think it's cutting off circulation to my brain."

"That would explain a lot," Vimes muttered.

Just then, a young man approached the group with the sort of confident swagger that usually preceded either a sales pitch or a marriage proposal. He was well-dressed in the manner of someone who wanted to appear more successful than he actually was, with rings on every finger and a gold tooth that glinted when he smiled.

"Excuse me, miss," he said to Nobby, sweeping off his hat with an elaborate flourish, "but I couldn't help noticing you from across the street. Such elegance! Such poise! Might I introduce myself? Reginald Threepwood, purveyor of fine exotic jewelry and precious stones from across the Circle Sea."

Nobby batted his eyelashes, which was a sight that would haunt Vimes's dreams for weeks.

"Oh my," Nobby simpered, clasping his hands together in what was presumably meant to be a feminine gesture of delight. "How very exciting! I'm Lady Nobitha of... er... Upper Ankh. I've only just arrived in the city and I'm positively overwhelmed by all the wonderful shops and... things."

"Ah, a lady of refinement!" Threepwood's eyes lit up with the predatory gleam of a man who thought he'd found easy prey. "Then you'll appreciate quality when you see it. Allow me to show you some pieces from my personal collection - jewels fit for royalty, madam, but priced for the discerning lady of moderate means."

He produced a velvet-lined case filled with what was obviously theatrical jewelry - the sort of gaudy paste gems that looked impressive in dim light but wouldn't fool a child in daylight.

"This particular necklace," he said, lifting a string of glass beads with all the reverence of a priest handling sacred relics, "was worn by the Empress of Klatch herself. Genuine rubies from the mines of Gebra, each one worth a king's ransom. Normally I wouldn't part with such a treasure for less than five hundred dollars, but for a lady of your obvious taste and breeding..."

"Five hundred dollars?" Nobby gasped, fanning himself with what appeared to be a lace handkerchief. "Oh dear, that does sound rather a lot. You see, I'm just a poor widow, trying to make my way in the world with only my dear departed husband's small inheritance."

Vimes had to admire Nobby's performance. The voice was pitch-perfect, the gestures were convincingly feminine, and the widow story was a nice touch that suggested both respectability and limited funds.

"A widow!" Threepwood's expression became appropriately sympathetic while his eyes calculated. "My dear lady, I had no idea. Please, allow me to offer you a special price - say, two hundred dollars? I know it's still a considerable sum, but this necklace would complement your natural beauty so perfectly..."

"Oh, but I don't know anything about jewelry," Nobby said helplessly. "How can I be sure it's genuine? I've heard there are unscrupulous people in the city who might try to take advantage of a simple woman like myself."

"Madam! I am shocked that you would even suggest such a thing!" Threepwood placed a hand over his heart with theatrical outrage. "These are my credentials!" He produced a scroll covered in official-looking seals. "Certified by the Guild of Jewelers and the Association of Precious Metals!"

Vimes squinted at the scroll from where he stood. Even from a distance, he could see it was a fishing license with some fancy borders drawn on in colored ink.

"Well," Nobby said, apparently studying the document with great care, "if you're sure it's genuine... But perhaps I should ask my friend here what he thinks?" He turned to gesture at Vimes. "This is my escort, Mister... er... Ironfoundersson. He's very wise about these matters."

Threepwood's face fell slightly as he took in Vimes's uniform and general air of authority.

"Ah. Your... escort. I see." His smile became somewhat more strained. "Well, I'm sure any friend of yours would recognize quality when they see it."

"Actually," Vimes said, stepping forward with his best intimidating copper expression, "I think I recognize you, Mr. Threepwood. Didn't we have a conversation last month about selling genuine Agatean silk that turned out to be painted potato sacking? And before that, wasn't there something about you trying to join a pirate crew with a vegetable-based sword fighting technique?"

Threepwood went pale. "I... that is... there must be some mistake... And it was a root vegetable! Very cutting edge sword work, that was!"

"Right then," Vimes said to Colon, "arrest him for attempting to defraud Lady Nobitha here. And check his credentials - I suspect that fishing license isn't quite what he claims it is."

"My pleasure, Commander," Colon said, producing his handcuffs with evident satisfaction.

As Colon moved in for the arrest, Nobby turned to Vimes with a triumphant grin.

"See? Effective policing through innovative disguise techniques!"

"Nobby, you're never wearing that dress again."

"What about for special occasions?"

"No special occasions."

"Undercover work?"

"No undercover work."

"What if Carrot needs a bridesmaid?"

Vimes started walking away. Behind him, he could hear Nobby explaining to the arrested jewelry seller that they were actually a policeman, which seemed to confuse the man more than the arrest itself.

"But you're wearing a dress!" the man protested.

"I'm a very modern policeman," Nobby replied cheerfully.

Vimes reflected that the Watch had come a long way from the days when their biggest challenge was staying sober long enough to collect their wages. He wasn't entirely sure it was progress, but it was certainly never boring.

### Chapter 9: The Crime Scene

A week later, Vimes found himself at a crime scene that was, even by Ankh-Morpork's considerably flexible standards, decidedly unusual. The location was a narrow house in Gleam Street, squeezed between a respectable bakery and a slightly less respectable establishment that claimed to sell "imported curiosities" but probably dealt in things that were better left unquestioned.

The house itself bore the sort of architectural confusion that suggested multiple renovations by people with dramatically different ideas about what constituted good design. The front door opened directly into a sitting room that had been decorated by someone who apparently believed that more was always better—wallpaper competed with carpets, which competed with furniture, which competed with an impressive collection of ornamental objects that defied easy categorization.

But it was the sequence of events inside that had caught Vimes's attention. Someone had murdered the victim—a middle-aged gentleman who, judging from the correspondence scattered around the room, had made his living as a private investigator. Then, apparently, someone else had tried to solve the murder, leaving behind notes, diagrams, and what appeared to be a detailed timeline of the victim's final day. Then someone had murdered the investigator, creating a second body and a second mystery. Then, in a development that suggested either remarkable dedication or complete insanity, someone had tried to solve that murder too.

The result was a crime scene that looked like a collaboration between a detective story, a mathematics textbook, and a particularly violent game of chess. Evidence had been catalogued, theories had been proposed, suspects had been identified and eliminated, and through it all, people had kept dying with what appeared to be remarkable consistency.

It was, Vimes reflected, like watching bureaucracy evolve in fast-forward, except with more corpses and considerably less paperwork.

He was examining a particularly elaborate diagram that appeared to chart the social connections of everyone within a three-block radius when Death appeared next to him with the sort of casual materialization that suggested he had been watching the proceedings with interest. The effect on the other Watch members was immediate and predictable—they suddenly discovered urgent business elsewhere, leaving Vimes alone with the bodies, the evidence, and an anthropomorphic personification who seemed remarkably cheerful about the whole situation.

"Death," Vimes nodded. "Come to see your handiwork?"

I DID NOT KILL THESE PEOPLE.

"I know. Wrong methodology. Too clean. Also, they were killed with a knife, not existential dread."

Death looked around the scene with professional interest.

WHOEVER DID THIS LACKS STYLE.

"That's what I was thinking. Multiple murders are fine, but you should commit to a theme. This is just sloppy."

EXACTLY. Death seemed pleased that Vimes understood. IF YOU ARE GOING TO KILL PEOPLE, YOU SHOULD DO IT PROPERLY.

"Professional standards are important in any field," Vimes agreed. "So, what do you think? Inside job?"

Death examined the bodies with the sort of attention that came from centuries of experience in the field.

THE FIRST VICTIM WAS KILLED BY SOMEONE HE TRUSTED. THE SECOND BY SOMEONE HE HIRED. THE THIRD BY CONFUSION.

"Confusion?"

HE WALKED INTO THE WRONG ROOM AT THE WRONG TIME AND ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTION.

"Which was?"

'WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?'

"Fatal question in this city. What about the fourth one?"

Death paused, looking slightly embarrassed, if an anthropomorphic personification could be said to look embarrassed.

THAT ONE WAS ACTUALLY ME. HE WAS SCHEDULED TO DIE OF NATURAL CAUSES, BUT THE TIMING BECAME... INCONVENIENT.

"So you just... expedited the process?"

I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS EFFICIENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.

Vimes made notes in his book, carefully not writing down the fact that Death had just confessed to what was technically murder, but was actually more like aggressive scheduling.

"Right. Well, that clears up the fourth victim. Now I just need to figure out who killed the other three."

I COULD TELL YOU.

"That would be cheating. Besides, half the fun is working it out yourself."

Death nodded approvingly. PERSISTENCE AGAIN.

"You keep mentioning that. Persistence. Like it means something special."

IT DOES. MOST PEOPLE GIVE UP.

"On what?"

EVERYTHING. LIFE. HOPE. ASKING QUESTIONS.

"And I don't?"

YOU ASK BETTER QUESTIONS.

Before Vimes could ask what that meant, Death was gone, leaving him alone with four bodies, a dozen clues, and the growing suspicion that he was part of someone else's investigation.

### Chapter 10: The Revelation

Two weeks passed with the sort of deceptive normalcy that Ankh-Morpork specialized in—the kind of routine that made you forget you were living in a city where the unusual was commonplace and the impossible happened twice on Tuesdays. Death appeared at random intervals with the casual unpredictability of a natural phenomenon, manifesting during meals, on patrol, while Vimes was wrestling with reports that seemed to reproduce when he wasn't looking, and once memorably while he was having what could charitably be called a "discussion" with the Patrician about budget allocations.

That particular encounter had taken place in Lord Vetinari's office, a room that had been designed to make visitors feel simultaneously impressed and slightly nauseous. The office occupied a space that was larger than it should have been, given the external dimensions of the building, and was decorated in what could only be described as "Aggressive Minimalism"—a style that suggested its occupant was too important to require actual furniture, but wealthy enough to afford very expensive empty space.

During the budget discussion—which had rapidly evolved from polite disagreement through pointed negotiation to what military strategists would recognize as a war of attrition—Death had simply materialized in one of the chairs and sat listening with the sort of professional interest that undertakers might show at a particularly well-organized funeral. He had occasionally nodded as if taking mental notes, though whether these concerned municipal finance or the philosophical implications of bureaucratic warfare was unclear.

The Patrician, to his considerable credit, had barely raised an eyebrow at this development. He had simply continued his explanation of why the Watch's budget requests were simultaneously too large, too small, insufficiently detailed, and unnecessarily specific, while occasionally glancing at Death with the sort of mild acknowledgment he might show a colleague who had dropped by to observe an interesting meeting. But then, Lord Vetinari was the sort of man who would have managed to negotiate with the apocalypse, probably getting it to reschedule for a more convenient time and possibly extracting some concessions about the terms and conditions of universal destruction.

That particular meeting had been... educational.

"Commander Vimes," Lord Vetinari had said, barely glancing up from his copy of the Ankh-Morpork Times, "I trust you are well? You look rather... accompanied today."

"I'm fine, my lord. Death is just... observing."

"Ah. How civic-minded." Vetinari had finally looked up, his gaze taking in Death with the same mild interest he might show a new type of filing cabinet. "Good morning, Death. I trust you are finding our municipal processes... illuminating?"

I AM LEARNING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.

"Excellent. One can never have too much education in the proper functioning of civic institutions." Vetinari turned a page with deliberate precision. "I was just reading this fascinating article about portable clacks towers. Apparently, some enterprising individual—a Mr. Moist von Lipwig, I believe you know him, Commander—is developing a system for installing them on carts. Mobile communication, as it were."

Vimes had glanced at Death, who was listening with what appeared to be professional interest. "That's... interesting, my lord."

"Indeed. The implications are quite staggering when one considers them fully." Vetinari steepled his fingers, a gesture that usually preceded what Vimes privately called a 'lecture disguised as a conversation.' "Imagine, if you will, the ability to coordinate across vast distances in real-time. Military applications are obvious, of course, but the commercial possibilities..." He paused, letting the thought hang in the air like incense.

"Commercial possibilities, my lord?"

"Oh, Commander. Consider a merchant who could communicate instantly with his warehouses, his ships, his... associates. No more delays, no more uncertainty about cargo arrivals. Supply and demand could be balanced with mathematical precision." Vetinari's smile was the sort that made hardened criminals confess to things they hadn't even thought of doing yet.

Death leaned forward with what appeared to be genuine interest. IT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY... EFFICIENT SYSTEM.

"Precisely, Death. Efficiency is the cornerstone of civilization. Though I can't help but wonder about the implications for law enforcement." His eyes had taken on that particular gleam that meant he was thinking several moves ahead of everyone else. "Imagine criminals coordinating their activities across the city in real-time. Or worse..." he paused for effect, "imagine if they could communicate while in moving vehicles. Drive-by clackings, as it were."

"Drive-by what now?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he already knew where this was going.

"Oh, nothing immediate to concern yourself with, Commander. Though it does raise interesting questions about the future of crime prevention. How does one patrol a crime that moves at the speed of light?" Vetinari appeared to consider this philosophical problem with genuine relish.

Death nodded thoughtfully. THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS QUITE FAST.

"Indeed it is, Death. Though not, I suspect, faster than a well-prepared mind." Vetinari smiled. "Which brings us to the question of preparedness. Commander, you might want to consider the budgetary implications of equipping your officers with mobile clacks units. For defensive purposes, naturally."

"My lord, we can barely afford stationary clacks units. The Patrician's Palace has better communication than the entire Watch combined."

"Yes, well. Perhaps we could discuss innovative funding solutions." Vetinari pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and began writing with the sort of deliberate care usually reserved for signing death warrants. "I'm sure the various Guilds would be interested in contributing to civic communication infrastructure. For a modest licensing fee, of course."

Death watched this process with fascination. YOU APPEAR TO BE SOLVING MULTIPLE PROBLEMS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

"One tries to be efficient, Death. For instance, the Thieves' Guild would naturally want to ensure that their... activities... remain properly regulated in an age of instant communication. A small contribution to Watch communication upgrades would demonstrate their civic spirit."

"You're going to tax them for the privilege of being policed better," Vimes realized.

"Tax is such an ugly word, Commander. I prefer to think of it as... subscription fees for municipal services. The Assassins' Guild, for example, would surely appreciate having better-equipped Watch officers. It makes their work more... challenging."

"They'd pay for the privilege of being hunted more effectively?"

"Commander, you underestimate the professional pride of our city's Guilds. Excellence recognizes excellence. They would see improved Watch capabilities as a mark of respect for their own skills."

Death appeared to be taking mental notes. THIS IS A VERY SOPHISTICATED APPROACH TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION.

"Thank you, Death. One finds that the key to successful governance is understanding that every problem is simply an opportunity viewed from the wrong angle." Vetinari finished writing and handed the paper to Vimes. "Here's a preliminary budget proposal. You'll notice I've included provisions for training, equipment maintenance, and a small contingency fund for... unexpected developments."

Vimes looked at the figures and blinked. "My lord, this budget is larger than our current annual allocation."

"Yes, well. One must plan for growth. Besides, I've already had preliminary discussions with several Guild representatives. They seem quite enthusiastic about the proposal."

"You discussed this before the technology even existed?"

"Commander, successful administration requires one to anticipate needs before they become urgent. By the time mobile clacks become commonplace, we'll already have the infrastructure in place to manage them properly." Vetinari leaned back in his chair with the satisfied air of a man who had just solved several problems that hadn't happened yet.

Death appeared genuinely impressed. YOU HAVE TURNED A POTENTIAL PROBLEM INTO A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY, A TRAINING EXERCISE, AND A DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE.

"Precisely, Death. Efficiency requires seeing the connections between seemingly unrelated elements. Crime, technology, Guild politics, municipal budgets—they're all part of the same system. Change one element, and you must adjust all the others accordingly."

"Is there anything you haven't thought of, my lord?" Vimes asked, though he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to know the answer.

"Well, Commander, I have been wondering about the potential applications of this technology for... other purposes." Vetinari's smile became thoughtful. "Imagine, for instance, the ability to conduct government business remotely. Cabinet meetings via clacks. Remote voting on municipal ordinances. Virtual court proceedings..."

"Virtual what?"

"Oh, nothing immediate, Commander. Just... future considerations. Though I should mention that I've asked Mr. Lipwig to include certain... security features... in his mobile clacks design. For public safety, naturally."

The conversation had continued in this vein for some time, with Death occasionally asking penetrating questions about governance theory and resource management. Vimes had left the meeting with a headache, a new budget proposal that somehow made financial sense despite being mathematically impossible, three new policy initiatives he didn't remember agreeing to, and the distinct impression that Death was learning far too much about the administrative complexities of modern policing.

Also, he was fairly certain that Vetinari had somehow managed to get Death to agree to serve as a consultant on municipal efficiency studies, though he couldn't quite remember how that had happened.

But then, the Patrician was the sort of man who would have managed to negotiate with the apocalypse.

### Chapter 11: The Problem

That evening, after what had been a particularly long day of municipal complications and criminal creativity, Vimes couldn't stand it anymore. The Watch House had settled into its usual nighttime quiet—the sort of institutional calm that came when the day shift had gone home and the night shift hadn't yet encountered anything that required immediate paperwork. The building creaked gently as it cooled, making the sort of noises that suggested either natural thermal contraction or possibly the presence of very large mice with architectural ambitions.

His office, lit by the warm glow of gas lamps and the occasional flicker of light from the fireplace, had taken on the comfortable shabbiness that came with years of being used as both workplace and occasional refuge. The walls were lined with filing cabinets that had given up any pretense of organization, bookshelves that contained everything from law books to treatises on criminal psychology to what appeared to be a complete collection of municipal regulations dating back to the founding of the city, and the accumulated detritus of three decades of police work.

He cornered Death near the window, where the anthropomorphic personification had been standing motionless for the better part of an hour, apparently contemplating the city lights with the sort of philosophical attention that most people reserved for art galleries or particularly complex mathematical equations.

"All right," Vimes said, settling behind his desk with the sort of determined finality that suggested he was prepared to stay there until he got satisfactory answers. The chair creaked under his weight—a familiar sound that had become as much a part of his evening routine as checking the locks and banking the fire. "Out with it. What's this really about? And don't tell me it's about persistence or asking questions or any of that philosophical nonsense. What's going on?"

Death turned from the window and sat in the chair across from Vimes's desk with the sort of fluid grace that belonged to someone who had never needed to worry about the normal constraints of joints, muscles, or basic physics. For a moment, the only sound in the room was the gentle ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece and the distant sounds of the city continuing its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous.

When Death spoke, his voice carried an odd note of what might have been uncertainty—a quality that was somehow more unsettling than confidence would have been.

I HAVE A... PROBLEM.

"What sort of problem?"

Death reached into his robe with the sort of careful deliberation that suggested he was handling something both precious and problematic, and produced what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary hourglass. Except that ordinary hourglasses didn't usually glow with their own inner light, and they certainly didn't contain what looked suspiciously like cigar smoke, lazily drifting from the top chamber to the bottom chamber and back again in a continuous loop that defied several fundamental laws of physics.

The hourglass itself was beautiful in the way that functional objects sometimes achieved when crafted by someone who understood both form and purpose. The glass was clear as crystal, the frame was worked in what appeared to be silver or possibly some metal that didn't exist in normal reality, and the whole thing hummed with the sort of barely audible energy that suggested it was connected to forces considerably more significant than local gravity.

YOUR LIFE TIMER, Death explained, setting the hourglass carefully on Vimes's desk where it continued to glow with gentle persistence. EVERYONE HAS ONE. WHEN THE SAND RUNS OUT, THAT IS WHEN I... ARRIVE. IT IS A VERY EFFICIENT SYSTEM, GENERALLY SPEAKING.

"Right. And mine is full of...?" Vimes leaned forward, studying the swirling contents with the sort of professional interest he usually reserved for particularly puzzling evidence.

CIGAR SMOKE. IT HAS BEEN MOST... PERPLEXING. Death's tone suggested someone who had spent considerable time thinking about a problem and had arrived at conclusions that pleased no one, least of all himself.

Vimes stared at the hourglass, transfixed by the hypnotic movement within. The smoke swirled and eddied with a life of its own, occasionally forming what might have been tiny figures engaged in what might have been arrests, paperwork, or possibly small-scale philosophical debates. Sometimes the patterns looked like miniature street scenes, complete with crowds and buildings and what appeared to be very small horses. Other times, they suggested abstract concepts—duty, perhaps, or justice, or the sort of stubborn determination that kept people working long after common sense suggested they should go home.

"How long has it been like this?"

SEVENTEEN YEARS. EVER SINCE YOU BECAME COMMANDER OF THE WATCH.

"And normally hourglasses contain...?"

SAND. OCCASIONALLY GLITTER, FOR PEOPLE WITH VERY DRAMATIC LIVES. YOURS IS THE FIRST I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THAT CONTAINS TOBACCO BY-PRODUCTS.

"So every time something should have killed me..."

THE SMOKE SIMPLY SWIRLS MORE VIGOROUSLY. IT IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL, ACTUALLY. BUT VERY... INCONVENIENT.

"Inconvenient how?"

Death seemed to struggle with the words. I HAVE BEEN... FOLLOWING YOU... BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS SIMPLY AN ANOMALY. THEN I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD MADE AN ERROR.

"And now?"

NOW I BELIEVE... Death paused, and his voice became quieter. I BELIEVE I MAY HAVE BECOME... PERSONALLY INVESTED... IN THE OUTCOME.

"Personally invested?"

I DO NOT WISH TO COLLECT YOU, COMMANDER VIMES.

The admission hung in the air between them like incense, heavy with implications that neither quite knew how to address.

"That's..." Vimes began, then stopped. "That's not how it works, is it? Death doesn't get to choose."

EXACTLY. WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN STUDYING YOU. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY... Death's voice trailed off.

"Why what?"

WHY I CARE.

There was a long silence. Outside, the city continued its eternal business of being complicated and morally ambiguous, but inside the Watch House, something fundamental was shifting.

"Death," Vimes said carefully, "are you telling me that you've been following me around because you don't want to do your job?"

IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. Death studied the hourglass, watching the smoke patterns. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED... FRIENDSHIP... BEFORE.

"Friendship?"

I BELIEVE THAT IS THE CORRECT TERM. I FIND YOUR COMPANY... PLEASANT. EDUCATIONAL. I ENJOY OUR CONVERSATIONS. THE THOUGHT OF ENDING THEM IS... DISTRESSING.

Vimes leaned back in his chair, trying to process this. "So the hourglass..."

BEGAN CHANGING WHEN I BEGAN TO CARE ABOUT THE PERSON WHOSE DEATH IT REPRESENTED. The admission seemed to cost Death something. I APPEAR TO HAVE... CONTAMINATED... MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES WITH PERSONAL FEELINGS.

"And that's a problem?"

DEATH IS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPARTIAL. INEVITABLE. I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE FAVORITES.

"But you do."

YES. Death's voice was barely audible. I DO.

Vimes lit a cigar and watched the smoke curl upward, noting how it seemed to echo the patterns in the hourglass. "You know, Death, I've been thinking about something you said. About asking better questions."

YES?

"Well, I've been asking myself why someone who should be dead keeps not dying. And I think the answer is that I'm supposed to be dead. Properly dead. Multiple times over."

THAT IS... ACCURATE.

"But I'm not. Because you don't want me to be." Vimes took a thoughtful drag. "Which raises an interesting question."

WHICH IS?

"If Death refuses to collect someone, are they actually dead or not?"

Death considered this with the sort of concentration usually reserved for cosmic equations. THAT IS... A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

"Because from where I'm sitting, it seems like I might technically be dead already. Just... not collected."

THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE HOURGLASS.

"Would it?"

CIGARS ARE OFTEN USED TO PRESERVE THINGS. TO PREVENT DECAY. Death paused. PERHAPS THE SMOKE REPRESENTS... PRESERVATION.

"Preservation of what?"

OF THE FRIENDSHIP WE HAVE BUILT.

Vimes studied his cigar. "So I'm being kept in a kind of... suspended animation by tobacco smoke and your refusal to do your job?"

IT APPEARS THAT WAY.

"Huh." Vimes took another puff. "That's either the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, or the most touching."

I PREFER TO THINK OF IT AS BOTH.

"Right then." Vimes stood up. "Well, this explains a lot. Lady Sybil always said my smoking would be the death of me. Turns out it's the opposite."

IRONY IS A POWERFUL FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE.

"Indeed. So what happens now?"

NOW? Death also stood. NOW I CONTINUE TO BE YOUR FRIEND. AND YOU CONTINUE TO NOT DIE.

"What about your professional duties?"

Death smiled, which was unsettling on a skull but somehow reassuring on this particular skull.

I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FRIENDSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROFESSIONAL EFFICIENCY. AND BESIDES... Death gestured to the hourglass. THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO HAVE ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION.

"Has it now?"

DEATH RATES THROUGHOUT THE DISC ARE PROCEEDING NORMALLY. APPARENTLY, ONE DELAYED COLLECTION DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OVERALL STATISTICS.

"So the universe is... fine with this arrangement?"

THE UNIVERSE, IT SEEMS, HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR.

Vimes laughed. "That's the most terrifying thing you've said yet."

I THOUGHT YOU WOULD APPRECIATE IT.

"I do. I really do."

### Chapter 12: The Family Discussion

Three days after Death's revelation about the hourglass, Susan walked through his study door without knocking. This was unusual only in that she usually came through the mirror or a wardrobe. Her expression suggested that someone was about to get a lecture.

SUSAN.

"Right. We need to talk." Susan sat down without being invited and fixed Death with the sort of stare she usually reserved for students who claimed their homework had been eaten by something mythological. "The Death of Rats came to see me."

AH.

"It brought charts, Grandfather. Charts showing death rates by district, species, and cause. Apparently there's been a statistical anomaly. Guess where?"

I ASSUME...

"Everywhere you've been patrolling with your policeman friend. Deaths down thirty percent. The whole cosmic balance is getting confused."

Susan pulled out a piece of paper covered in squeaky handwriting. "Also, I've had Albert round asking if you've been eating properly, three separate gods wanting to know why their worshippers aren't dying on schedule, and the Auditors... well, let's just say they're taking an interest."

Death reached into his robe and produced Vimes's hourglass. I CAN EXPLAIN.

"Cigar smoke." Susan examined it briefly. "Well, that's new. Though knowing this family, probably not the strangest thing that's happened this week."

I HAVE DEVELOPED... PROFESSIONAL APPRECIATION... FOR COMMANDER VIMES.

"Professional appreciation that's keeping him alive indefinitely?"

IT APPEARS SO.

Susan sighed. "Right. Well, that's inconvenient."

INCONVENIENT?

"Yes, because now I have to deal with the fallout. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to run a classroom when your supernatural inheritance keeps interfering with normal mortality? Last week a student's goldfish didn't die when it was supposed to. The class spent three hours discussing the philosophical implications of immortal pets."

Death considered this. I HAD NOT CONSIDERED THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS.

"Of course you hadn't. You never do." Susan stood up. "Look, I don't particularly care if you want to keep one policeman alive forever. But could you please keep the cosmic disruption to a minimum? Some of us have to live in the real world."

WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

"Figure it out. Quickly. And try not to break anything important while you're doing it." Susan headed for the door, then paused. "Also, Binky misses you. He's been staring hopefully at the stable door for weeks."

Susan left through the window, which was technically impossible but had never stopped her before.

Death sat alone, contemplating the hourglass and the growing realization that his personal feelings were having rather more widespread consequences than he had anticipated.

Perhaps it was time to have another conversation with Commander Vimes.

---

### Chapter 13: The Understanding

A month later, Vimes was doing his evening rounds through the more philosophical parts of the city—those neighborhoods where the streets had names like "Empirical Crescent" and "Theoretical Square," and where the residents were the sort of people who spent their evenings debating the fundamental nature of reality rather than worrying about more practical concerns like municipal taxation or the rising price of cheese.

Empirical Crescent was one of Ankh-Morpork's more thoughtful addresses, curved in a gentle arc that suggested its builders had been familiar with advanced mathematical concepts and possibly a bit too fond of showing off their knowledge. The houses were well-maintained examples of what architectural historians called "Confident Rationalism"—a style that expressed the belief that the universe was fundamentally comprehensible and that proper application of logic could solve most problems, including the problem of where to put the windows.

The crescent was lined with gas lamps that cast pools of warm, steady light, creating the sort of atmosphere that encouraged reflection and deep thought. It was the kind of place where you might expect to encounter philosophers taking evening constitutional walks, or perhaps the occasional academic who had become so absorbed in contemplating abstract concepts that they had forgotten to go home for dinner.

Vimes found Death sitting on one of the public benches that the city had installed for the convenience of residents who needed somewhere to sit while working through particularly complex intellectual problems. The bench was positioned to provide an excellent view of the crescent's garden, which had been designed according to principles of geometric harmony and featured the sort of carefully arranged plantings that suggested someone had strong opinions about the relationship between natural beauty and mathematical precision.

"Evening," Vimes said, settling beside Death with the comfortable ease of someone who had grown accustomed to having philosophical conversations with anthropomorphic personifications. The bench was solid and well-crafted, built to withstand both weather and the weight of serious intellectual contemplation. "Contemplating the universe?"

I AM CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE, Death replied, his voice carrying the sort of thoughtful cadence that suggested he had been giving these matters considerable attention. AND FRIENDSHIP.

"Heavy topics for a Thursday evening," Vimes observed, though he had learned that conversations with Death tended toward the metaphysical regardless of the day of the week.

Death turned the hourglass over in his hands, watching the smoke swirl. I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID. ABOUT ASKING BETTER QUESTIONS.

"And?"

I HAVE BEEN ASKING MYSELF... WHAT IS THE POINT OF DEATH?

"That's... quite a question."

FOR CENTURIES, I BELIEVED THE ANSWER WAS SIMPLE. DEATH PROVIDES MEANING TO LIFE. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TIME IS LIMITED MAKES EACH MOMENT PRECIOUS.

"Sounds reasonable."

BUT NOW I WONDER... WHAT IF DEATH'S REAL PURPOSE IS TO TEACH THE LIVING ABOUT WHAT MATTERS?

"Go on."

YOU HAVE SPENT SEVENTEEN YEARS DEFYING DEATH. NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF DYING, BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. PEOPLE TO PROTECT. A FAMILY TO CARE FOR.

"That's true."

YOUR REFUSAL TO DIE HAS SHOWN ME THAT LIFE IS NOT ABOUT DURATION. IT IS ABOUT PURPOSE. CONNECTION. THE DIFFERENCE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE.

Vimes took a drag on his cigar. "And that's why the hourglass changed?"

I BELIEVE SO. WHEN I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES, THE NATURE OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH DEATH CHANGED. Death paused. I STOPPED BEING THE END OF STORIES AND BECAME... INVESTED IN HOW THEY CONTINUE.

"So friendship saved my life?"

FRIENDSHIP SAVED US BOTH, Death said quietly. YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME TO VALUE EXISTENCE. I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE TIME TO CONTINUE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

They sat in companionable silence for a while, watching the gentle rhythm of the city as it continued its eternal business of being simultaneously complicated and morally ambiguous. The evening had settled into that peaceful period when most honest citizens were safely home with their families, and even the dishonest ones were taking a break to consider their life choices. Gas lamps flickered like stars along the crescent, and somewhere in the distance, a clock tower chimed the hour with the sort of dignified authority that suggested time was being properly managed by responsible municipal authorities.

"You know," Vimes said eventually, breaking the comfortable quiet with the sort of practical observation that came from years of dealing with domestic logistics, "Lady Sybil is going to want to invite you for dinner again. She's convinced you need more social interaction. She's already planning the menu, and I suspect she's been consulting cookbooks about supernatural dietary requirements."

I WOULD ENJOY THAT, Death replied with what sounded like genuine pleasure. YOUNG SAM PROMISED TO SHOW ME HIS TOY SOLDIERS. HE HAS APPARENTLY DEVELOPED NEW TACTICAL THEORIES INVOLVING CAVALRY CHARGES.

"Right then. Sunday it is." Vimes stood up, his joints creaking in the way that reminded him he wasn't as young as he used to be, though he was probably more experienced in dealing with supernatural dinner guests than most people his age. "Shall we continue our patrol? The night's still young, and crime never rests."

INDEED, Death agreed, rising from the bench with the sort of fluid grace that suggested he had never needed to worry about aging joints or the accumulated wear and tear of physical existence. He tucked the hourglass away in his robe with careful precision. THOUGH I SUSPECT TONIGHT WILL BE QUIETER THAN USUAL.

"Why's that?" Vimes asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.

WORD HAS GOTTEN AROUND THAT DEATH HIMSELF IS PATROLLING THE STREETS. THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED A SUDDEN INTEREST IN LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR. IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE CAN REASSESS THEIR LIFE PRIORITIES WHEN PRESENTED WITH APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES.

Vimes grinned. "Best arrest rate in the history of the Watch. I should put you in for a commendation."

I WOULD PREFER A SMALL RAISE. I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MORTAL EXISTENCE REQUIRES CURRENCY.

"Right. I'll talk to Vetinari about the budget. Though knowing him, he's probably already allocated funds for 'Supernatural Consultant Services.'"

As they walked through the quiet streets of Empirical Crescent and beyond, their footsteps echoing in comfortable rhythm on the well-maintained cobblestones, Vimes reflected that some of the best partnerships were the ones you never saw coming. The city around them seemed somehow more peaceful than usual, as if even the architecture had decided to behave itself for the evening. Street lamps burned with steady flames, shadows fell in predictable patterns, and the general atmosphere suggested that the universe had temporarily suspended its usual interest in cosmic irony.

Death had taught him that persistence was more than just stubborn refusal to give up when any sensible person would have surrendered to the inevitable. It was about continuing to care when caring was difficult, about maintaining hope when hope seemed irrational, and about doing the right thing even when the right thing was considerably more complicated than the alternatives.

And in return, Vimes had apparently taught Death that some things were worth preserving forever—not because they were perfect or pure or eternally significant, but because they represented something fundamentally decent in a universe that often seemed to have misplaced its moral compass.

Behind them, tucked safely away in Death's robe, the hourglass continued to glow with its gentle, persistent light. The smoke within swirled eternally in patterns that spoke of duty fulfilled, friendship honored, and the sort of stubborn determination that kept the world functioning despite the best efforts of chaos, bureaucracy, and human nature. It was not a sign of cheating death, but rather a symbol of something that had transcended the normal boundaries between life and whatever came after—a friendship that had somehow convinced the universe to make an exception to its usual rules.

It was, Vimes thought as they turned onto Broad Way and began their patrol of the city's quieter quarters, a pretty good deal all around. Some people got gold watches when they retired. Some got pensions or honors or recognition from their peers.

He got to be friends with Death.

All things considered, he could live with that arrangement. Possibly forever.

---

*The End*

**Author's Note:** *In which we learn that sometimes the most unlikely friendships are the ones that change everything. Death may be inevitable, but apparently, it's also capable of making exceptions for truly exceptional stubbornness, and friendship can preserve what bureaucracy would destroy.*

*No cosmic constants were permanently harmed in the making of this story, though several had their feelings hurt and at least one filed a complaint with the union.*
