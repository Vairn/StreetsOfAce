An arcade-style game for the Amiga 1200 built for [AmiGameJam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/amigamejam).

## About

**Streets of Ace** is an original arcade-style game created specifically for the AmiGameJam 2025 competition. The theme challenges developers to create games worthy of their own arcade cabinet, targeting classic Amiga hardware with modern development techniques.

### Competition Details
- **Event**: [AmiGameJam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/amigamejam)
- **Timeline**: June 1st - December 1st, 2025
- **Theme**: Return of the Arcade - games worthy of arcade cabinets
- **Platform**: Amiga (targeting A1200 with AGA chipset)

## Features

- **AGA Enhanced Graphics**: Utilizes the advanced graphics capabilities of the Amiga 1200
- **Arcade-Style Gameplay**: Classic arcade mechanics with modern polish
- **Optimized Performance**: Direct hardware access for maximum speed
- **OS-Friendly**: Graceful integration with AmigaOS

## Technical Stack

- **Engine**: [ACE (Amiga C Engine)](https://github.com/Vairn/ACE/tree/AGA) - AGA Branch
- **Language**: C/C++ with assembly optimizations
- **Build System**: CMake with CPM package management
- **Graphics**: AGA chipset targeting 256+ colors
- **Audio**: MOD/sample-based audio system

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment
- **CMake** 3.15+ 
- **Cross-compiler** for 68000/68020 (e.g., m68k-amigaos-gcc)
- **Python 3.7+** (for asset processing tools)

### Target Hardware
- **Amiga 1200** or compatible (AGA chipset required)
- **2MB+ RAM** recommended
- **Hard drive** or CF card for development builds

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone <repository-url> StreetsOfAce
cd StreetsOfAce
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 2. Process Assets

```bash
cd Tools
python process_all_gifs.py
cd gifd_tools
python json_to_binary_converter.py -r ../gifdelta/batch_output/
```

### 3. Deploy to Amiga

Copy the built executable and assets to your Amiga system.

## Development Tools

### GIF Animation Pipeline
The project includes a sophisticated GIF processing pipeline:

- **Delta Extraction**: Optimizes animations by extracting only changed pixels
- **Binary Format**: Converts JSON metadata to compact binary format (60-80% size reduction)
- **C Integration**: Provides C libraries for efficient runtime loading

See [`Tools/README.md`](Tools/README.md) for detailed tool documentation.

## ACE Engine Integration

This project uses the AGA-enhanced branch of the ACE engine, which provides:

- **AGA Screen Support**: Enhanced graphics modes beyond OCS/ECS
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Direct but safe hardware access
- **Performance Focus**: Minimal overhead, maximum speed
- **OS Compatibility**: Runs from Workbench, exits gracefully

## Building

### CMake Configuration

The project uses CPM (CMake Package Manager) to automatically fetch and build the ACE engine:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

### Debug Builds

For development with runtime error checking:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

## Asset Pipeline

### Graphics
- Source graphics in PNG/GIF format
- Automated conversion to Amiga-compatible formats
- Palette optimization for AGA modes
- Sprite atlas generation

### Audio
- MOD tracker files for music
- WAV samples for sound effects
- Automatic format conversion
